# 🌐 Love.Craft Athens — Beta Website  

This repository contains the beta website created for our **UGA New Media Institute Capstone (2025)**.

The purpose of this site is to document our team’s work, showcase our redesign concepts, and present the updated artist portfolio experience we created in partnership with **Love.Craft Athens**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is *not* the official Love.Craft Athens website.  
> It is a standalone page created to demonstrate our team’s design, development, and UX work.
> The "Our Product" button is currently functioning (redirects to LoveCraft's website); however, the organization is going through some updates for the new year, so the artists' pages have been disabled for now!
